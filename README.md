Learning through doing is a method that many programmers use to learn new things in their craft. In an upcoming blog. Learning any language by writing small apps (Under construction) I'll explore this in more detail. 

These apps a Clojure implementations of the learning apps discussed in the blog. Their intention is to be used as a refrence for those trying out this technique.
